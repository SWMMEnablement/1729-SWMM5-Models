*       <<<<<<<<  SWMM 4.4G EXTRAN DATA FILE >>>>>>>>>
*
*
*       September 2000
*       New D2 and D3 lines.
*
*       This is an input data file to the SWMM 4.4G (CDM) Extran Block
*       for modeling the hydraulics of sewer or open channel systems.
*       All lines with an asterisk in column 1 are comment lines
*       and are ignored by the program.  All information following
*       an asterisk on an input line are considered to be comments also.
*       The user should get in the habit if using asterisks to separate
*       data from comments.
*
*       Input data are free format and may be up to 230 columns wide.
*       You must have a value for every data column even if the program
*       will not actually use a given value.  There must be at least one
*       space or comma between every input value.  Alphanumeric data must
*       be enclosed in single quotes.
*
*       Caution!  Data lines that are "wrapped around" (continued on
*       two or more lines) should have a blank in column 1, unless a
*       card identifier is needed.
*
*       In general, SWMM parameters with names that begin with the letters
*       I,J,K,L,M,N are integers (e.g., NSCRAT() ), following the usual
*       Fortran convention, and entered values must not include a
*       decimal point.
*
*       To avoid literary quotes being printed in output, use $NOQUOTE
*       after MM line.
*
*       SWMM uses both U.S. customary units and metric units.  The
*       examples use feet, cfs, acres, inches and inches/hour.  If metric
*       is specified substitute meters, cms, hectares, millimeters and
*       millimeters/hour.  If metric is used, internal compuations in
*       the Extran Block are also performed in metric units.
*============================================================================
*       The SW card sets up the interface files to be used or created.  In this
*       example there is one output file (#8) that will contain the time series
*       of flows for subsequent blocks.
*       By default, this file contains flows at all outfalls at
*       each time step.  If you don't need this output, leave JOUT equal
*       to zero to avoid writting results to scratch file which is
*       is subsequently erased.  If INTER is entered as a negative number,
*       then detailed output of model configuration, depths, and flows
*       are written to the file associated with JOUT in ASCII format.
*
*       Extran does not perform pollutant routing.  If pollutants are
*       included on an input interface file, they are ignored.
*============================================================================
*  NBLOCK  JIN(1)  JOUT(1)
SW    1      0       0
*============================================================================
*   The MM card opens the scratch files to be used by different subroutines.
*   A certain number (up to 5 for EXTRAN) may be required for each block.
*  NSCRAT(1) - Save results for summary outout (unformatted sequential)
*  NSCRAT(2) - Hot start input and output file (unformatted sequential)
*  NSCRAT(3) - B9 writing of flows at specified conduits (ascii or
*    unformatted sequential)
*    Note, must define NSCRAT(3) with @-line if use B9 line option.
*  NSCRAT(4) - Read and write irregular channel data to scratch file
*  NSCRAT(5) - Read tidal history data from ASCII file

*
*============================================================================
*     The @ command is used to save an interface or scratch file
*     permanently, or to access a previously saved file.  This line should
*     be placed before the first SWMM block call.  The format of the @
*     command is as follows:
*============================================================================
* Note, must define DOS name for NSCRAT(3) when using B9 option.
@              3                        'dw_3_pipe.ts'
*     If file names are not defined on the @ line, the program will attempt
*     to read the file names from the command line. For example, enter the
*     following at the dos prompt, in the batch file, or on the Windows run
*     line to run swmm.exe, read input from IN.DAT, write output to OUT.OUT,
*     and save JOUT = 8 output to EXDOC.INT.

*Column 1
$ANUM
* $ANUM  ==> Use alphanumeric names for EXTRAN conduits and juctions.
*            If used in one block than alphanumeric must be used in in all
*            prior and subsequent blocks.  Names (IDs) must be enclosed in
*            single quotes.  Names can include up to 10 characters.
*            When using default output tables, a maximum length of 6
*            characters is recommended.  This Version 4.4G includes
*            option to provide alternative output tables that will print all
*            10 digits or characters of the file names (see JP10 input on BA

*
*       NSTART: First time-step to begin print cycle.

*  The BD line is optional and may be excluded.  This line allows input of

*  then base flow rates remain constant (e.g., baseflow factors are set to

*
*  The maximum number of sets of BD lines is defined by parameter statement

*
*  The first input on the BD line is the number of input values for this SET.

*
*  If 12 values are specified, the program assumes that the first value is

*
*  If a number other than 12 is used, the program assumes that the first value

*  month.  Note that the starting date of the storm is defined by IDATEZ on
*  the B1 line (or as defined on the transfer file from RUNOFF???).  If the

*  the end of the conduit with the lower invert elevation.
*  Inflows to the model must be simulated as a flow from FROMSEG 0 and
*  outflows to the model are simulated as a flow to TOSEG 0.  In this
*  version, all inflows and outflows to the model must be represented

*                The average channel slope for type 8 or 12.
*                This slope is used only for developing a rating
*                curve for the channel.  Routing calculations use invert
*                elevation differences divided by length.  If a slope
*                approximately equal to the true slope, or HGL slope
*                is used, than the capacities listed for the section will
*                approximate the actual capacity.
*
*                SPHI can now also be used to limit the maximum positive
*                flow in a conduit.  For types other than 6, 8, 7, or 12
*                enter a non-zero SPHI to use this option.
*                The maximum flow in the conduit is then limited to
*                this value:  IF Q > SPHI THEN Q = SPHI
*                Note that positive flow in EXTRAN is defined as flow
*                from end of the conduit with the higher invert elevation
*                to the end of the conduit with the lower invert elevation.
*                Entering a negative number may produce unexpected results.

*                (e.g., curves relating area, hydraulic radius, and wetted perimeter

*        The C2 (NC), C3 (X1), and C4 (GR) data lines are for any type 8
*   conduit.  They follow as a group after all C1 lines have been entered.
*   The sequence for channels must be in the same order as the earlier

*   lines C2-C4 can be used by more than one channel.  I.e., different
*   channels can have the same STHETA values.
*
*        Data groups C2, C3 and C4 correspond to HEC-2 lines NC,

*   may be identified either by EXTRAN identifiers (C2, C3, C4) or

*        The C2 line is used to input natural channel roughness.

*                   = 4 Variable speed in-line pump.
*                       Pumping rate depends on depth in pumped junction.
*                       Pumping rate varies linearly between input
*                       PRATE/VRATE points.  Rate is constant at rate
*                       defined by first PRATE for depths less than VRATE(1).
*                       Rate is constant at rate defined by last PRATE for
*                       depths greater than last VRATE.  PON and POFF are
*                       optional inputs.  If entered, pump comes on when
*                       depth equals or exceeds PON and pump turns off when
*                       depth is less than POFF.
*                   = 5 Lift station type pump.  This pump type was added to
*                       more realistically simulate the operation of typical
*                       pump stations.  PRATE(1), PRATE(2), and PRATE(3) are individual
*                       pumping capacities of the installed pumps.  Pump # 1 with
*                       capacity of PRATE(1) comes on at depth specified by VRATE(1) in
*                       the pumped junction and and stays on until water levels in
*                       the pumped junction drop to POFF.  Similarly, Pump # 2
*                       with capacity of PRATE(2) comes on at depth specified
*                       by VRATE(2) and stays on until water levels drop to POFF.
